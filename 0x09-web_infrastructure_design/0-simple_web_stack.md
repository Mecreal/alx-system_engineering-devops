# Simple Web Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com
![The design of simple infrastructure ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mecreal/alx-system_engineering-devops/main/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/server0.png)
## Introduction
This document outlines the design of a simple web infrastructure for hosting the website accessible via www.foobar.com. The design involves a single server setup with several components, each fulfilling a specific role.

## Infrastructure Components and Their Detailed Roles

### 1. Server
- **Definition:** A server is either a physical or virtual machine that hosts the necessary components for running a website. It serves as a powerful computer dedicated to managing network resources and serving data to other computers (clients).
- **Role:** In this context, the server is responsible for hosting the web server (Nginx), application server, the application files (the website's codebase), and the database (MySQL). It has a specific IP address, which in this case is 8.8.8.8, mapped to the domain name foobar.com.

### 2. Domain Name (foobar.com)
- **Role:** The domain name functions as a user-friendly, readable address for accessing websites on the internet. For our website, the domain name "foobar.com" is what users will type into their web browsers to access the site.

### 3. DNS Record (www in www.foobar.com)
- **Type and Role:** The 'www' in www.foobar.com is commonly a subdomain and is typically configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record in the Domain Name System (DNS). This record points to the primary domain (foobar.com), which in turn is linked to the server's IP address. The DNS system is responsible for translating the human-readable domain name into the numerical IP address of the server.

### 4. Web Server (Nginx)
- **Role:** Nginx, the chosen web server software, handles incoming HTTP requests from clients (like web browsers). It serves web content, primarily static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, and efficient handling of concurrent connections.

### 5. Application Server
- **Role:** The application server is the environment where the backend application runs. It processes user requests received from the web server, executing the business logic of the application, potentially interacting with the database, and then sends the processed data back to the web server.

### 6. Application Files (Code Base)
- **Role:** These files constitute the source code of the website, including the application's logic, libraries, and other dependencies necessary for the functioning of the website.

### 7. Database (MySQL)
- **Role:** MySQL, a widely-used relational database management system, is responsible for storing and managing the data required by the website. This includes user data, content, and other relevant information.

### 8. Communication Protocol
- **Role:** The server and the clientâ€™s computer communicate using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. This involves the client sending a request over HTTP(S), which is received and processed by the server, with the response then being sent back to the client in the form of a web page or other data formats.

## Issues with This Infrastructure Design

### 1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- **Explanation:** The entire website relies on a single server. Any hardware or software failure in this server would render the website inaccessible, as there is no redundancy or backup system in place.

### 2. Downtime During Maintenance
- **Explanation:** Maintenance activities such as deploying new code, updating the web server, or performing system updates require the server to be restarted or taken offline temporarily. This results in periods where the website is not accessible to users.

### 3. Scalability Concerns
- **Explanation:** The infrastructure is limited in its ability to handle increased loads or spikes in traffic. If the website experiences a surge in visitors, the single-server setup may become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times or a complete service outage.
